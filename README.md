Pony Feud
=========
This is some sort of thing for playing a pony version of Family Feud, designed to be a standalone application to run in your browser. Check config.js to add your own answers, then open index.html in your browser.

I have no idea who originally made this custom-made-for-Maxie program, but it didn't worked on Maxie's computer so I just quickly ported it to Javascript.
